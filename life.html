                        <p>Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of three children and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA player Joe Bryant. His middle name, Bean, came from his father's nickname "Jellybean". Kobe started playing basketball when he was three and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up.</p>
                        <p>When Kobe was 6, his father retired from the NBA and his family moved to Italy to where his father continued playing professional basketball. Kobe became fluent in Italian during his time there and began studying and playing a lot of basketball. He would sometimes work at his father's games as a ball and mop boy and would practice shooting at halftime. When Kobe was 13, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia.</p>
                        <p>Kobe Bryant played high-school basketball Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman, the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team. During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year and earned a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination. He considered going to Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova for college, but when high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Kobe also sarted to think about going straight to the NBA.</p>
                        <p>During high school, the 76ers coach John Lucas invited Kobe to work out and scrimmage with the team. In his senior year of high school, he led his high school to their first state championship in 53 years where he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocks. Kobe ended his high-school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time leading scorer at 2,883 points.</p>
                        <p>Kobe was named the Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today All-USA First Team player his senior year. As a 17-year-old, Kobe decided to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so.</p>
                        <p>Kobe Bryant was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th pick in the 1996 and quickly traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. He spent all 20 seasons on his NBA career with the Lakers and went on to have a lot of success. This includes winning the NBA Finals 5 times in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, and 2010 and winning NBA MVP award in 2008. Kobe retired after the 2015-2016 NBA season after scoring 60 points in his final game against the Utah Jazz. He was a 6 feet 6 inch shooting guard that went down as one of the greatest scorers and players in the history of the NBA. He finished his career with the fourth most points scored in NBA history including an 81-point performance on January 22, 2006 against the Toronto Raptors. He spent his first 10 NBA season wearing number 8 and his last 10 NBA seasons wearing number 24. Both of these numbers have since been retired by the Los Angeles Lakers. </p>
                        <p>Kobe married Vanessa Laine on April 18, 2001. His first daughter Natalia was born in January of 2003 followed by his second daughter Gianna in May of 2006. They later had a third daughter born in December of 2016, Bianka, and a fourth born in June of 2019, Capri. While playing in the NBA, Kobe also received the nickname "Black Mamba" because of his work ethic and fire for the game of basketball. This work ethic and resiliency was named "Mamba Mentality."</p>
                        <p>On January 26, 2020, Kobe Bryant (41), his daughter Gianna (13), and seven other people were taking a helicopter ride from Orange County, California to Ventura County, California for a basketball game at Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks. At 9:45 a.m., the helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain a little bit northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Kobe, his daughter "Gigi", and the seven other people on the helicopter all tragically died on impact. This news came as a shock to the whole world beacuase of how much of an impact Kobe had on the world and specifically on the game of basketball.</p>
